Portable optical microscope

Optical microscopy is a pivotal technique for biomedical discovery, yet many high-performance instruments remain bulky and poorly suited for live-cell imaging and on-site computational analysis. This limits their accessibility and practical use in experiments requiring quantitative assessment of cellular dynamics. To address these challenges, we present a compact benchtop microscope that integrates an electrically tunable liquid lens (ETL), transport-of-intensity-equation (TIE)–based phase imaging, and edge-based artificial intelligence (AI) analysis within a single platform. A compact 2 ×  objective combined with an electrowetting ETL enables rapid, vibration-free axial defocus control with a measured magnification variation of 3.3 ± 0.2% over a 5.9 mm focal range, facilitating electronic acquisition of defocused intensity images required for TIE-based phase recovery. The 20 cm-tall modular system incorporates transparent heater–based environmental control for microfluidic cell culture and supports optional dual-channel fluorescence and wide-field imaging modules. For automated analysis, the microscope is coupled to an edge AI device that performs on-device cell segmentation, classification, and tracking from in-focus bright-field images using a convolutional neural network. By combining ETL-based electronic defocus, non-interferometric phase imaging, and edge-based bright-field image analysis in a compact form factor, the system provides label-free phase visualization alongside low-latency AI-assisted analysis, offering a practical and compact personal microscopy solution for research, education, and training applications.
