Optical microscopy is a pivotal technique for biomedical discovery, yet many high-performance instruments remain bulky and poorly suited for live-cell imaging and on-site computational analysis. This limits their accessibility and practical use in experiments requiring quantitative assessment of cellular dynamics.
